# WIP NixOS Config

⚠️ **Work in progress** — a modular, refactored version of my NixOS + home-manager setup.

## Goals

- Multi-host support
- Easy experimentation
- Clear, readable structure (of both code and dirs)
- Self-contained modules wherever possible
- Handy tools included

> Please, never use this configuration, because it's probably ass. If you find a bug, anti-pattern, mistake or anything of that kind - be sure to laugh and cyberbully me for it.
