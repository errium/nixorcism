#+html: <i>Errium's incredible NixOS config.</i>
#+html: </div>

* State
It was, is, and always will be *WIP*. I tinker, explore the Nix ecosystem, and stay open-minded to all kinds of software. I'll modify this config as frequently as I want - like, I could literally drop home-manager tomorrow.

* Tools
Too many to list and I keep switching, so I won't bother.

I write this config (& everything else) in *helix* with *nixd* as LSP and *alejandra* as formatter. My primary shell is *fish*, with *bash* as fallback. For QoL I have: *zoxide*, *nh*, *nix-search-tv*, and *opencode* for occasional vibecoding 😼

If you really want to know what I use — check ~modules/~ and ~hosts/dudos-machine/~.

* "Should I run this on my hardware?"
*Lmao, nah.* This is for reference only and was never intended for public usage. After all, this repo isn't named "Omarchy: The Sequel." 🤷
