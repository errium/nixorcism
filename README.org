/Errium's incredible NixOS config./

* 🔧 What's the state?
It was, is, and always will be *WIP*.
I tinker with my configs, explore the Nix ecosystem, and stay open-minded to all kinds of software. Because of that, this config will change as often as I feel like it.
Like, I could literally drop home-manager tomorrow.

* 📠 What tools do I use?
There are waaay too many things I use, and I keep switching, so I won't bother listing *everything*.

I write this config /(& pretty much everything else)/ in *helix* with *nixd* as LSP and *alejandra* as formatter.
My primary shell is *fish*, with *bash* hanging around as a fallback /(just in case)/.
For shell QoL I have:
- *zoxide* - to jump around directories
- *nh* - for a slightly better Nix experience
- *nix-search-tv* - to find more bloatware to install
- *opencode* - for occasional vibecoding 😼 /(jk)/

I use a lot more tools, but I’m not listing them here - chances are I’ll swap something out tomorrow and forget to update this README.
If you *really* want to know what I use, poke around in ~modules/~ and ~hosts/dudos-machine/configuration.nix~ /(my main machine)/.

* 💬 "Man, I really like your config. Should I run it on my hardware?"
*Lmao, nah.*
This repo is for *reference only* and was never intended for public consumption.
After all, it’s not called *"Omarchy: The Sequel."* 🤷

I made this README because other cool people do. It won't have much useful info and probably will never be updated.
Please don't actually use this — it's probably ass. If you find a bug or anti-pattern, feel free to laugh and cyberbully me for it.
