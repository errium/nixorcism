* 🔧 What's the state?
It was, is, and always will be *WIP*.
I tinker with my configs, explore the Nix ecosystem, and stay open-minded to all kinds of software. Because of that, this config will change as often as I feel like it.
Like, I could literally drop home-manager tomorrow.

* 📠 What tools do I use?
There are waaay too many things I use, and I keep switching, so I won't bother listing *everything*.

I write this config /(& pretty much everything else)/ in *helix* with *nixd* as LSP and *alejandra* as formatter.
My primary shell is *fish*, with *bash* hanging around as a fallback /(just in case)/.
For shell QoL I have:
- *zoxide* - to jump around directories
- *nh* - for a slightly better Nix experience
- *nix-search-tv* - to find more bloatware to install
- *opencode* - for occasional vibecoding 😼 /(jk)/

I use a lot more tools, but I’m not listing them here - chances are I’ll swap something out tomorrow and forget to update this README.
If you *really* want to know what I use, poke around in ~modules/~ and ~hosts/dudos-machine/configuration.nix~ /(my main machine)/.

* ✨ "What cool things do you have in here?"
Glad you asked /(ik you didn't, but whatever)/.
Few things I'm particularly proud of:

🎨 *Theming* is done via [[https://github.com/nix-community/stylix][stylix]] with dynamic palette generation from wallpapers using [[https://codeberg.org/explosion-mental/wallust][wallust]]. Swap a wallpaper with my ~retheme~ script >> rebuild >> entire system recolors. Two modes: ~theming_static~ for fixed palettes, ~theming_dynamic~ for wallust-generated ones.

💽 *Installation* is handled by ~install.sh~, a cool unattended installer I made - boot a NixOS ISO, clone the repo, run the script, pick a host. Disko handles partitioning declaratively, no manual fdisk gymnastics.

🧬 *Architecture* follows the [[https://github.com/mightyiam/dendritic][dendritic pattern]] - every file is a [[https://flake.parts][flake-parts]] module. No ~default.nix~ import chains. System, home-manager, and flake config all live in the same file when they belong together.

* 💬 "Man, I really like your config. Should I run it on my hardware?"
*Lmao, nah.*
This repo is for *reference only* and was never intended for public consumption.
After all, it’s not called "Omarchy: The Sequel." 🤷

P.S.
I made this README because other cool people do. It won't have much useful info and probably will never be updated.
Please don't actually use this — it's probably ass. If you find a bug or anti-pattern, feel free to laugh and cyberbully me for it.
